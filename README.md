We are recreating U.N Squadron which is a videogame released in 1989 for the CP Arcade System by Cpcom. This project has been done by four students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain).

## About the game

It is a side-scroll shooter where the player controls a militar airplane and defeats a great amount of enemy hordes mainly based in tanks and other airplanes. The player has to defeat every stage till reaching the final fight which will let you return home happily if you defeat the final boss. This game was developed in Japan based in the anime series Area 88.
